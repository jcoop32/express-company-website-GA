  <h3>
    Welcome to Pixelverse Games
  </h3>
  <p>The home of immersive and genre-defining RPG
    experiences! We are a small, passionate team of four based in the vibrant
    heart of New York City's Harlem district. Since our founding, we have
    dedicated ourselves to crafting captivating stories and visually stunning
    sprite-based worlds that leave a lasting impact on players.</p>
  <h3>Our Journey Begins üèÅ</h3>
  <p style="color: green">
    Pixelverse Games was born out of a shared love for the golden age of
    role-playing games and a desire to create unique and memorable gaming
    experiences. Our founders, Mamadou and Josh, avid gamers and visionaries, recognized
    the potential to bring together a talented group of individuals to create
    something truly special. Established in 1990, we set up our humble studio in a
    cozy loft in Harlem, where creativity flows freely amidst the rich cultural
    tapestry that surrounds us. With a focus on building intimate and meticulously
    crafted RPGs, we embarked on our journey to redefine the boundaries of
    storytelling and pixel art.

    At Pixelverse Games, we firmly believe that storytelling lies at the heart of
    every great RPG. Our team of talented writers, artists, and developers work
    harmoniously to bring our imaginative worlds to life. Each game we create is a
    testament to our dedication to creating unforgettable adventures that resonate
    with players. Weaving together intricate narratives, complex characters, and
    meaningful choices, our games offer a depth of storytelling that draws players
    into immersive, emotionally charged experiences. From the dramatic highs to
    the poignant lows, we strive to elicit a range of emotions that keep players
